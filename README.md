# skarcade - A smart productivity suite
**skarcade** is a collection of apps to help you effectively achieve your study goals and stay in touch with life. Manage your study your way - achieve that organisation you've always strived for. 

## For students, by students
**skarcade** is developed by students, just like you, who understand the caveats with existing notetaking apps - and aim to share our suite of extra kicks that maximise your marks.

## What's included
* **Starlight**: More than just a glorified word processor. Starlight allows you to create meaningful and organised notes, that unlike traditional notes, are readable - an issue we struggled to perfect. No longer will your notes be ominous walls of text; but tools to your retention of knowledge. Starlight also allows for smart collaboration, sharing, handwriting and teaching. Note taking and remote learning has never been easier.
* **Name TBA**: Keep track of your classes, upcoming assessments, and schedule your life. Nothing makes school more overwhelming than walking into class and realising you forgot to do your work. 
* **Name TBA 2**: Time is of the essence in studying. Keep track of your time with our display of study and practice exam timers, water checks, task reminders, and sleep trackers. 
* **Name TBA 3**: Work and play go hand in hand. As gamers ourselves, we understand study is incomplete without breaks. **Name TBA 3** gives you just that.
